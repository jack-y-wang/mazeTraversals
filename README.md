# Maze Traversals
A maze game that people can solve or have a visualization of a search algorithm solve made 
for students in the 2019 UNCF CS Summer Academy Data Structures Course.
### Maze Solver
A visualization of Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth Firsth Search (DFS), 
and A* search algorithms. The user can select to generate random mazes for
a search algorithm to solve or see them be performed on an emtpy maze.
### Tree Traversals
A visualization of tree search algorithms on a fixed binary tree to help
understand the order in which nodes are queued and visited.
